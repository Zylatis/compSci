# Waxing lyrical about computer science things
This is a set of basic implementations of common CS algorithms and data structures, along with a few applications in exercise form. The material covered here is largely motivated by GeeksForGeeks articles and "Cracking the Coding Interview" book, both of which I highly recommend.

### Covered so far (in some form or another)
#### Algorithms
- Quicksort
- Merge sort
- Radix sort
- Shortest distance from start node to all nodes in a graph (Dijkstra)
- BFS (see problems below)
- Basic DFS to find connected node with given value
- Edit distance (Levenshtein - rederived this one actually! sans one bug... )
- Arbitrary precision arithmetic sum (product is the hard/important one though...)
- Basic linked list operations (reversal, cycle detection; not optimized)

#### Data structures
- Max heap
- Graph (not very well though)
- Linked list (even worse than graph)
- Hash map

#### Classic problems
- 1/0 Knapsack 
- Coin change
- Permutations of a string
- Largest Sum Contiguous Subarray problem (brute force and my own attempt at homegrown Kadane)
- Remove invalid parentheses in string with fewest number of deletions using BFS (finds multiple solutions)
