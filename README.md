# Waxing lyrical about computer science things
This is a set of basic implementations of common CS algorithms and data structures, along with a few applications in exercise form. The material covered here is largely motivated by GeeksForGeeks articles and "Cracking the Coding Interview" book, both of which I highly recommend.

### Covered so far (in some form or another)
#### Algorithms
> Quicksort
> Merge sort
> Radix sort
> Permutations of a string
> Algorithm for Largest Sum Contiguous Subarray problem (brute force and my own attempt at homegrown Kadane)
> Algorithm to remove invalid parentheses in string with fewest number of deletions using DFS (finds multiple solutions)
> Dijkstra

#### Data structures
> Max heap
> Graph (not very well though)
> Linked list (even worse than graph)
> Hash map
